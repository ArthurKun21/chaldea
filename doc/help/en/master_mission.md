## Master Mission

One quest has "x" enemies with Attribute A and "y" enemies with Attribute B, but we cannot know the count of enemies who has both attributes. 

**Or**/**And** mode: e.g. 2 Attribute A, 4 Attribute B, and 9 Attribute C in one quest

**Or**: 2+4+9=15, mostly used
**And**: min(2,4,9)=2, most quests may not meet the requirements and will be ignored, the corresponding mission with no related quest will be gray.
