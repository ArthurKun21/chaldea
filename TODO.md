# TODO

There are plenty of work need to do.

## Battles

### High Priority

- [x] catch error for user interaction (skill/attack)
- [ ] show loading toast when fetch api
- [ ] `Map<TargetId, bool> lastFuncSuccess` is a map

### Recorder
- [ ] BattleServantActionHistory.TYPE: HPLOSS,INSTANT_DEATH,REDUCE_HP,DAMAGE_REFLECTION,DAMAGE_VALUE

### Ally Function Logic:

- [ ] After 7th anni, donotAct will not stop first card from contributing to FirstCardType
- [ ] Unify buff execution, eliminate unnecessary calls to buff.shouldApply and switch to buff.shouldActivate to check
      for buff useRate
- [ ] disable NP if NP has no functions
- [ ] BuffScript should only be checked when buffType matches
- [ ] Move all checkTrait logic into battle and remove individual checkTrait methods in models
- [ ] There is a bug that will reset accumulation damage when deathEffect is triggered
      not verified for gutsEffect
- [ ] FuncType damageNpCounter
- [ ] FuncType damageNpRare Target == 0 is target, verify if Target ==1 is activator?
- [ ] FuncType gainHpPer figure out if Percentage heal benefits from healGrant buff
- [ ] FuncType gainHp/NpFromTargets & moveState can probably be implemented in the dependedFunc with an additional
      receiver argument to receive what's lost from absorbTargets
- [ ] DataVals AddLinkageTargetIndividualty & BehaveAsFamilyBuff & UnSubStateWhileLinkedToOthers
- [ ] DataVals CounterId CounterLv CounterOc SkillReaction UseTreasureDevice
- [ ] DataVals TriggeredFuncPosition ignored, only checking previous function success for now
- [ ] Group npDamageIndividualSum & buff ParamAddCount's counting logic together?
- [ ] BuffType doNotGainNp & upGiveNp
- [ ] BuffType doNotRecovery interacts with maxHp?
- [ ] BuffType doNotActCommandType
- [ ] BuffType doNotSelectCommandCard
- [ ] BuffType tdTypeChange: if there are multiple instances of this buff, the last one dominates
  - [ ] the max addOrder, should be safe to use the last effective one
- [ ] BuffType overwriteClassRelation, atkSide first or defSide first? When two overwriteForce type interact, is it
      based on buff order? E.g. Kama skill3 & Reinis NP vs alterego attacker, is the final relation 500 or 1000 or depends
      on which buff comes last?
- [ ] BuffType preventDeathByDamage works if Van Gogh has burn?
- [ ] BuffType reflectionFunction
- [ ] BuffType skillRankUp has a maxRate of 0, so it's probably not a ValuedBuff? Currently only counting by buffTrait
- [ ] INDIVIDUALITIE seen on fields, buffTraits, servantId, are other traits included as well?
- [ ] update INDIVIDUALITIE to only check its state in certain situations, perhaps in checkBuffStatus()?
- [ ] includeIgnoredTrait only adds NP card traits for now
- [ ] more sample on convertBuff's scripts
  - [ ] BuffConvert is converting a buff list to another buff list, (or trait list to another buff list, not used yet)
- [ ] prepare a dummy BattleServantData as Master
- [ ] Figure out how to write reasonable test cases for UI required effects like randomEffect & changeTdType
- [ ] funcSuccess for some wired function types
- [ ] Enemy shift target may not exist
- [x] cardDetail.damageRate/tdRate (U-Olga Marie buster/extra attack on all enemies)
- [ ] dispBreakShift
- [ ] shiftGuts(Ratio)
- [x] Damage should remove buff with buffScript field damageRelease: 1
- [x] FuncType transformServant may need a local copy of Hyde data
- [x] `DataVals.ProcPassive` will add buff to passive list, even if it's called from an active skill. Same for `ProcActive`

#### Unknowns:

- [ ] DataVals ProgressSelfTurn
- [ ] DataVals CheckDuplicate

### Team setup

- [ ] svt/enemy: edit indivs, ~~skills, tds~~

### Common Simulation

- [ ] manually remove/add buff
- [ ] manually apply skill(custom activator/target)
- [ ] Transform: what if skill/td has upgrades or disabled?
  - Currently matching id for upgrades.
- [ ] add ce event skill on/off
- [ ] Let user choose event point buff(s) and save to battle global params, used for addState.upDamageEventPoint,
      buff.parma=vals.Value+pointBuff.value
- [ ] Custom skill! (passive or active)
- [ ] Player side `allyTargetIndex` could be null or -1, let user to choose manually
- [x] skill cd/sealed/cond hint: sealed(Ã—)>cd(n)>cond(*, only shown when cd=0&not sealed)
- [x] Servant/Enemy without TD:
  - [x] tdId=0
- [x] Servant skill.num=1 means Skill 1, don't use index in list. `groupedActiveSkill[1/2/3]`
- [x] change `groupedActiveSkill` from list to dict
- [x] Auto select extraPassive (event bonus)
- [x] SkillRankUp: get skill from api if not in db, make init async
- [x] add svt.extraPassive on/off

### NPC Simulation

- [ ] Account for NP disabled NPCs (they don't gain any NP)

### Enemy Simulation

- [ ] build enemy active skills & cards & NP
- [ ] BuffType upNpturnval & downTurnval (if not npsealed, npCount += 1 + upTurnval - downTurnval)
- [ ] TargetType ptSelfAnotherRandom for svt 251 skill 3
- [ ] TargetType enemyOneNoTargetNoAction for svt 311 skill 3
- [ ] FuncType transformServant on enemies
- [x] Check Atlas for enemy trigger functions

## Misc

- [ ] Extra Mission descriptor

- [ ] filter_group_data: default value
- [ ] svt icon: custom image
- [ ] plan_tab: append/active/all
- [ ] cards: weak/strength

- [x] skill/np/quest/voice/profile condition

## Adding more pages

- [x] Summon list and detail page
  - [ ] summon plan: ?
- [x] Saint Quartz estimate
  - [ ] poor performance
- [ ] Buff/Function reversing with remote data
- [ ] Support Party generation

## Server side

- [x] item/skill recognition
- [x] account system: server or cloudflare?
  - [ ] ~~auto-backup user data~~: must manually backup
- [ ] recognizer: invalid image error
